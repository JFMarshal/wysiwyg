This is a custom jQuery WYSIWYG editor plugin made with content editable HTML5 elements, dynamically created buttons with Font Awesome icons. When the project is finished it will be an editor made by/for developers, with the ability to override any events, styles, or markup you want without having to modify the plugin.
